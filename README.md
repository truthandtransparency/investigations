# Investigations

This repository hosts code used in technical investigations from [Truth & Transparency](https://truthandtransparency.org), a nonprofit, investigative newsroom dedicated to promoting transparency within religious institutions.

Each dated directory will contain code used in the story published by Truth & Transparency on that same date. Each README.md file will include instructions on how to execute the code. A technical write up on Truth & Transparency's tech blog (coming soon!) outlining how the code was leveraged may also be linked to in the README.md.
